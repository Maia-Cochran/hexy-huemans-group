# ColoRandom - by the Hexy Huemans

## Cohort 2205 Group Project
### Contributors: Maia Cochran, Jeff Cook, Shauna MacFarlane-Okongo & Patrick Becker

### Overview

We built a site that generates color palettes for the user. Similar to other sites like coolors, we present users with various random colors which they can choose to “save” (note: saved palettes will not persist across page refreshes). Users can “lock” a color, which will keep that color when a new palette is generated.

This project will gave us an opportunity to write HTML and CSS, and leverage JavaScript to both create a data model and interact with the DOM.

Additionally, as our first group project, we got the chance to continue to hone our team skills: communication, planning, proper git and GitHub workflow.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/colorandom.html).

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Features
A user will get a random color palette of five colors upon visiting the site. With the push of a button they can generate a whole new palette of five new colors. If they want, they can choose to lock one or more of the colors they like so they do not change when they push the New Palette button. If they like all five colors, they can push the Save Palette button and it will save the palette on the right side of the page as a smaller version. If they decide they no longer like the palette they have saved, they are able to click the trash can icon to delete it from the page.
